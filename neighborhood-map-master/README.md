This is the Project of the Neighborhood Map from [Udacity's Front End Web Developer Program](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

In this project, I created a map using the Google Maps API of Düsseldorf City. In this map my favorite restaurant locations in Düsseldorf are shown!
